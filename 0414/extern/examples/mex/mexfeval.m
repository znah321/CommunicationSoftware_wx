%MEXFEVAL Function evaluation.
%   If F is a string containing the name of a function (usually
%   defined by an M-File), then MEXFEVAL(F,x1,...,xn) evaluates 
%   that function at the given arguments.  For example, 
%   F = 'foo', MEXFEVAL(F,9.64) is the same as foo(9.64).
%   MEXFEVAL is usually used inside functions which have the names
%   of other functions as arguments.
