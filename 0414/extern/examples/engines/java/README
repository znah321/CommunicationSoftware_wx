The files in this directory are:
1. EngineGUIDemo
2. EngineConsoleDemo  

The EngineGUIDemo uses a Swing UI to take an input number and calculate the factorial of the given number.

The EngineConsoleDemo creates a matrix, finds the elements less than 5 and squares the returned elements. 

You can use the following commands to build and test the examples:

In the below example, replace <matlabroot> with the value returned by the "matlabroot" command in MATLAB.
On Windows:
-----------
Compile:
javac -classpath <matlabroot>\extern\engines\java\jar\engine.jar EngineConsoleDemo.java
javac -classpath <matlabroot>\extern\engines\java\jar\engine.jar EngineGUIDemo.java

To run the example applications, you need to add the following path to the PATH variable:
<matlabroot>\bin\win64

Change path each time you run the application
To set the run-time library path from the Windows command prompt, type the following command. Set the path every time you open the Windows Command Processor.

set PATH=<matlabroot>\bin\win64;%PATH%

To permanently change path

Windows 10:
In Search, search for and then select: System (Control Panel)
Click Advanced system settings > Advanced tab.
Click Environment Variables.
Under System variables, select Path and click Edit.
Modify Path by inserting <matlabroot>\bin\win64; at the beginning of the Variable value.
Click Ok to close the dialog boxes, then close the Control Panel dialog box.

Run:
java -classpath .;<matlabroot>\extern\engines\java\jar\engine.jar EngineConsoleDemo
java -classpath .;<matlabroot>\extern\engines\java\jar\engine.jar EngineGUIDemo

On Mac:
-----------
Compile:
javac -classpath <matlabroot>/extern/engines/java/jar/engine.jar EngineConsoleDemo.java
javac -classpath <matlabroot>/extern/engines/java/jar/engine.jar EngineGUIDemo.java

To run the example applications, add <matlabroot>/bin/maci64 to either the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH variable or to the Java library search path.

To add "<matlabroot>/bin/maci64" to the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH variable:

C Shell
setenv DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH <matlabroot>/bin/maci64

You can place these commands in a startup script, such as ~/.cshrc.

Bourne Shell
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=<matlabroot>/bin/maci64:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH 

You can place these commands in a startup script such as ~/.profile.

Run:
java -classpath .:<matlabroot>/extern/engines/java/jar/engine.jar EngineConsoleDemo
java -classpath .:<matlabroot>/extern/engines/java/jar/engine.jar EngineGUIDemo


Run the examples by adding "<matlabroot>/bin/maci64" to the Java library search path without setting the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH variable:

java -Djava.library.path=<matlabroot>/bin/maci64 -classpath .:<matlabroot>/extern/engines/java/jar/engine.jar EngineConsoleDemo
java -Djava.library.path=<matlabroot>/bin/maci64 -classpath .:<matlabroot>/extern/engines/java/jar/engine.jar EngineGUIDemo

On Linux:
-----------
Compile:
javac -classpath <matlabroot>/extern/engines/java/jar/engine.jar EngineConsoleDemo.java
javac -classpath <matlabroot>/extern/engines/java/jar/engine.jar EngineGUIDemo.java

In order run the example applications, add the following paths to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable:
<matlabroot>/sys/os/glnxa64
<matlabroot>/bin/glnxa64

C Shell
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH <matlabroot>/bin/glnxa64:<matlabroot>/sys/os/glnxa64

You can place these commands in a startup script, such as ~/.cshrc.

Bourne Shell
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<matlabroot>/bin/glnxa64:<matlabroot>/sys/os/glnxa64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH 

You can place these commands in a startup script such as ~/.profile.

Run:
java -classpath .:<matlabroot>/extern/engines/java/jar/engine.jar EngineConsoleDemo
java -classpath .:<matlabroot>/extern/engines/java/jar/engine.jar EngineGUIDemo


If a compatible GCC library is in the search path, you can add "<matlabroot>/bin/glnxa64" to the Java library search path and run the examples without setting the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable (for MATLAB version R2016b, the supported GCC version is 4.9): 

java -Djava.library.path=<matlabroot>/bin/glnxa64 -classpath .:<matlabroot>/extern/engines/java/jar/engine.jar EngineConsoleDemo
java -Djava.library.path=<matlabroot>/bin/glnxa64 -classpath .:<matlabroot>/extern/engines/java/jar/engine.jar EngineGUIDemo
